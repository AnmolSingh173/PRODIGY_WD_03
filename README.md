Welcome to my interactive and engaging Tic Tac Toe web application! This project was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this application, users can enjoy a classic game of Tic Tac Toe against each other right in their web browsers.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Implemented functions handle user clicks, track the game state, and check for winning conditions, providing an immersive gaming experience.

- **Two-Player Mode:** Users can play against each other, adding a competitive and social dimension to the game.


## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Choose your symbols, either "X" or "O."
3. Take turns with your opponent to place your symbol on the board.
4. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol wins the game.
